# Cassava-Leaf-Disease-Classification

this study will take advantage of the advantages of CNN, namely being able to classify an object intended for image data so that the CNN model will be used as an introduction to the four types of healthy cassava leaf and cassava leaf diseases that can be found in Indonesia. By using the Tensorflow library, the results of model trials and evaluations of cassava leaf images show an accuracy of 0.8538 for training and 0.7496 for data validation. So it can be concluded that the implementation of Deep Learning with the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) method can detect cassava leaf disease images.

Researches stages:

* Collecting data from [Keggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/cassava-disease/data)
* Preprocessing Data
* Setting up Machine Learning Parameters
* Train Model
* Evalution
* Interpretation of Result
* Convert Model to TFLite for Mobile Apps
